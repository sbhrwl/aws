## Database Types
- RDBMS (= SQL / OLTP)
  - RDS, Aurora â€“ great for joins
- NoSQL database
  - DynamoDB (~JSON), 
  - ElastiCache (key / value pairs), 
  - Neptune (graphs) â€“ no joins, no SQL
- Object Store
  - S3 (for big objects)
  - Glacier (for backups / archives)
- Data Warehouse (= SQL Analytics / BI)
  - Redshift (OLAP), Athena
- Search
  - ElasticSearch (JSON) â€“ free text, unstructured searches
- Graphs
  - Neptune â€“ displays relationships between data
- Timeseries
  - InfluxDB
