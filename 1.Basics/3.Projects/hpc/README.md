## HPC   
- The cloud is the perfect place to perform HPC (High performance computing)
- You can create a very high number of resources in no time
- You can speed up time to results by adding more resources
- You can pay only for the systems you have used
- Perform genomics, computational chemistry, financial risk modeling, weather prediction, machine learning, deep learning, autonomous driving
- Which services help perform HPC?
  - `Elastic Fabric Adapter` (EFA)
    - Improved ENA for HPC, only works for Linux
    - Great for inter-node communications, tightly coupled workloads
    - Leverages Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard
    - Bypasses the underlying Linux OS to provide low-latency, reliable transport
