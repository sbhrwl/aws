## Cloud computing
- Cloud computing is a way of using information technology (IT) that has these `five` equally important traits
- First, customers get computing resources that are `on-demand and self-service`.
  - Through a web interface, users get the processing power, storage, and network they need with no need for human intervention.
- Second, customers get access to those resources `over the internet`, from anywhere they have a connection.
- Third, the cloud provider has a `big pool` of those resources and allocates them to users out of that pool.
  - That allows the provider to buy in bulk and pass the savings on to the customers.
  - Customers don't have to know or care about the exact physical location of those resources.
- Fourth, the `resources are elastic`, which means theyâ€™re flexible, so customers can be.
  - If they need more resources they can get more, and quickly.
  - If they need less, they can scale back.
- finally, customers `pay only for what they use`, or reserve as they go.
  - If they stop using resources, they stop paying.
