# IdentityFederation

## Where are Users?											
### In organisation					
- LDAP					
- AD					
- Customer Identity broker					
### On the Web					
- Facebook					
- Google					
- Cognito User Pool (CUP)					

## Identity Federation											
- Identity Federation is 
  - process of **authenticating users** via User Pool that you may or may not own (guest users) and then 
  - **providing the needed permission** to access a resource or perform an operation										

## Identity Federation in AWS
- Federation lets users outside of AWS to **assume temporary role** for accessing AWS resources.
- These users assume **identity provided access role**
- Federations can have many flavors
  1. SAML 2.0
  2. Custom Identity Broker
  3. Web Identity Federation with Amazon Cognito
  4. Web Identity Federation without Amazon Cognito
  5. Single Sign On
  6. Non-SAML with AWS Microsoft AD
- Using federation, you donâ€™t need to create IAM users (user management is outside of AWS)
- **IAM and Cognito can be used for Identity federation**

## STS Assume Role									
- Allows temporary, limited access to AWS resources	
- Token is valid for 1 hour	
### AssumeRole	
- Within your account for enhance security	
- For Cross Account Access- assume role in target account to perform actions there	
1. **AssumeRole with SAML**	
  - Return credentials for user, who is logged in with SAML	
2. **AssumeRole with WebIdentity**
  - Return credentials for users logged in with IdP (Facebook, Google)	
  - Instead of using WebIdentity use Cognito	
3. **GetSession Token**
  - GetSession token via MFA	
  - For AWS user or Root account user	

4. **Using STS to Assume a Role**
  - Define an IAM Role within your account or cross-account
  - Define which principals can access this IAM Role
  - Use AWS STS (Security Token Service) to retrieve credentials and impersonate the IAM Role you have access to (AssumeRole API)
  - Temporary credentials can be valid between 15 minutes to 1 hour
5. **Assume Role with SAML2**
  - SAML2 LDAP					
	- To Integrate LDAP based Identity store with AWS					
	- Provides access to AWS console and CLI					
	- No need to create IAM users for the employees of the organisation					
  - **SAML2 ADFS**
	- To Integrate AD based Identity store with AWS					
	- Provides access to AWS console and CLI					
	- No need to create IAM users for the employees of the organisation					

## Other types of Identity Federation
- Via **Custome Identity Broker**
  - Any other Identity store except LDAP or AD, It must also make AP- call to AWS to generate Token
- Via **Web Identity Broker**
  - Use Cognito instead
- IAM and Cognito can be used for Identity federation											
- Federation through SAML is OLD way of doing things, use Amazon SSO instead											

## SAML 2.0 Federation
- To integrate Active Directory / ADFS with AWS (or any SAML 2.0)
- Provides access to AWS Console or CL- (through temporary creds)
- No need to create an IAM user for each of your employees

## AWS Cognito
### Goal
- Provide direct access to AWS Resources from the Client Side (mobile, web app)
### Example
- Provide (temporary) access to write to S3 bucket using Facebook Login
### Problem
- We do not want to create IAM users for our app users
### How
- Log in to federated identity provider or **remain anonymous**
  - Get temporary AWS credentials back from the Federated Identity Pool
  - These credentials come with a pre-defined IAM policy stating their permissions
