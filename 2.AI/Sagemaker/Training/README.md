# Training

## Training and Deploying a model with Amazon SageMaker
<img src="images/1.png">

## Training
- Distribute training across one or many instances 
- Managed model training infrastructure
- Scales to Petabyte datasets 
- Compute instances for training are automatically launched and released
  - Stores artifacts in S3 

## 2. To train models on SageMaker use										
- SageMaker Console 
- SageMaker SDK and 
- Jupyter Notebook

## 3. What information does a Training Job needs?										
- To train a model in SageMaker, you create a training job. 
- The training job includes the following information:
  - The URL of S3 bucket where youâ€™ve stored the training data.
  - The compute resources (EC2) that you want SageMaker to use for model training. 
    - Compute resources are ML compute instances that are managed by SageMaker.
  - The URL of the S3 bucket where you want to store the output of the job.
  - The Amazon Elastic Container Registry path where the training code (Algorithm) is stored."
